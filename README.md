# I'm Bahhzinga

Born in the United Kingdom, I'm a software developer who has been working with computers from an early age, with that interest eventually evolving into software. Personally, I don't have any favourite languages in particular, however I'm fluent in Object Oriented and Event Driven programming languages - my attitude is **if you can learn one, you can learn them all**.

## A bit more about me

I'm a student at University Centre Somerset, enrolled in a Level 6 degree in IT and Digital Technologies, studying anything from networking all the way to interactive interface design. In the coming years I'll be studying ethical hacking, VR development and much more - subjects I'm anticipating to master.

## What do I write?

Well, I tend to write Minecraft plugins in Java for my own amusement, however I'm a novice user of the .NET framework and have experience developing user interactive interfaces. I like diving into different languages and new challenges.

## Where can you contact me?

You can find me as **Bahhzinga#0001** on Discord and I'll aim to get back to you within a few hours at most.
